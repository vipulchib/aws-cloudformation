# Overview
Purpose of this post is to outline the basics of creating AWS resources using Cloud Formation as a service.

# What is CloudFormation
CloudFormation can be interpreted as the ability to make an underlying API call to AWS to provision and configure AWS resources.  Its an automated way to create, modify and delete AWS resources.  CloudFormation templates can either be created using the AWS CloudFormation Designer (https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/designer) or a a JSON or YAML-formatted document.  In this document we will go through CloudFormation examples using the YAML format.

We will create a 'stack' (a collection of all the AWS resrouces we plan to craete) using a CloudFormation YAML-formatted script.  This can be done from the CloudFormation AWS Console reachable via this URL - https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/ or using the AWS CLI.  More information on AWS CLI installation is available here - http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html
